# Stochastic Modeling  
This repository is a collection of jupyter notebooks focused on stochastic modeling.  
## Monte Carlo Method with Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)  
As a starter model, the Geometric Brownian Motion model is used to simulate future stock prices based on the past 5 years of historical stock data from yfinance. Here, I've applied the Monte Carlo method by running 1000 simulations.  
## Monte Carlo Method with Heston Volatility  
For a more realistic simulation of stock prices, I am considering applying the Heston Volatility model to the Monte Carlo method.
